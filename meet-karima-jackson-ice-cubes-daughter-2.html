Her youngest sibling, Shareef Jackson, is a basketball enthusiast but has not started pursuing a career yet. Her siblings are quite talented and are doing great in their various endeavors.</p><h3><strong>Karima Jackson’s Education</strong></h3><p>There are no credible details about the schools that Karima Jackson attended in elementary and high school. However, based on the fact that she grew up in Los Angeles, she might have attended prestigious schools there.</p><p>Upon graduation from high school, she enrolled at Rutgers University, where she obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in Sociology. She later moved on to bag a Master’s degree in Child Advocacy from Montclair State University. Karima is not just an intelligent lady but also a goal-getter, as she added another Master’s degree in Public Administration to the bag from Rutgers University. At the moment, she is pursuing her doctorate degree and will add it to the bag in no distant time.</p><h2><strong>Karima Jackson is Famed For Being Ice Cube’s Daughter</strong></h2><p>Though Karima Jackson is doing great in her career, she only came to the limelight because of her father’s fame. Her father, Ice Cube, whose real name is O’Shea Jackson Sr., is a film producer, songwriter, actor, and rapper. He was born in Los Angeles on June 15, 1969, to a hospital clerk and custodian Doris, and to a machinist, and UCLA groundskeeper, Hosea Jackson.

She is also a reserved person and has remained tight-lipped about the details of her parents and siblings, as well as what they are up to. There are also no credible details about the schools that she attended, but it is presumed that she had a good educational background. Kimberly Woodruff is not just a humanitarian but a mother who stands to protect her family at all costs.</p><h3><strong>Karima’s Parents Were College Sweethearts</strong></h3><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Ice Cube</a> and Kimberly Woodruff saw each other for the first time in college but did not get along so well because the latter was not interested. After six months, fate brought them together once more, and this time things got interesting as she showed interest in Ice Cube. They began dating shortly, but there are no records of how long they dated. In 1991, they got engaged, and by 1992, they got married, though the type of wedding that they had was not mentioned.</p><p>Karima Jackson’s parents have sustained a blissful marriage, and today their marriage has lasted 31 years and counting.

Though their parents have not reacted to the questions so far, they were born on the same day and location. Furthermore, information about Ice Cube welcoming a child outside of his marriage has never existed, which infers that the sisters are twins. Meanwhile, Deja Jackson maintains a low profile, and as such, much is not known about her.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The best four years ever.</p><p>Deja Jackson's been a part of some legendary teams for the Quakers and will leave Penn as a 3️⃣-time Ivy League champion, earning a degree in Communication from the College of Arts and Sciences! <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/nJMr61uYRU</a></p><p>— Penn WBB (@PennWBB) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">May 19, 2019</a></p><p>She attended Avenu Academy of Beauty and Culture before enrolling at the University of Pennsylvania, where she earned a degree in communication and a minor in Hispanic studies.
