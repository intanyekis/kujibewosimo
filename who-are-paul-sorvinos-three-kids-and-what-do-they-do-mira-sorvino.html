One of the first people to eulogize the fallen star was his daughter, Mira, who wrote a moving tribute in a post on her Twitter account. “My father the great Paul Sorvino has passed. My heart is rent asunder - a life of love and joy and wisdom with him is over. He was the most wonderful father. I love him so much. I’m sending you love in the stars Dad as you ascend,” she wrote. Mira is the first of Paul Sorvino’s three children, all of them from the first of his three marriages – to occupational therapist Lorraine Davis.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Real Reason Paul Sorvino Almost Quit Goodfellas</a></span></p><h2 id=mira-and-michael-sorvino-are-also-actors><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Mira And Michael Sorvino Are Also Actors</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All of Paul Sorvino’s children have attempted to follow in his acting footsteps. Firstborn Mira and last-born Michael have, however, enjoyed more success in it than their sister, Amanda.</p><p>Michael has notably lent his voice as lead character Tommy Angelo in the famous video game, Mafia. He has also appeared in dozens of movies and TV shows. Mira’s most distinguished works include Norma Jean & Marilyn, The Replacement Killers and Mighty Aphrodite.</p><h2 id=amanda-sorvino-has-also-dabbled-in-the-film-industry><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Amanda Sorvino Has Also Dabbled In The Film Industry</span></h2><p>Although not remotely as successful as the rest of her family, Amanda Sorvino has also worked a bit in the film industry. At the zenith of her Hollywood career, she wrote a drama film titled The Trouble With Cali, which her father starred in, alongside her two siblings and their cousin, Bill Sorvino.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amanda also wrote a short film called The Wind in the Reeds in 2017, and played a character called Melody in the Greg Travis romantic drama Midlife from 2015.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Celebrity Kids Who Are More Famous Than Their Parents</a></span></p><h2 id=mira-sorvino-is-an-academy-and-golden-globe-award-winner><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Mira Sorvino Is An Academy And Golden Globe Award Winner</span></h2><p>There is no doubt that despite her father’s storied career, Mira Sorvino is officially the most accomplished artist in her family. Among many other accolades, the actress is the recipient of both an Academy Award, as well as a Golden Globe Award.</p><p>Both these trophies were for Best Supporting Actress, for her portrayal of the character Linda Ash in the 1995 comedy film Mighty Aphrodite by Woody Allen. Mira has since joined the pantheon of <a href=#>actors who have spoken out against the filmmaker</a>, following <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his fall from grace</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=michael-sorvino-also-works-as-a-film-producer><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Michael Sorvino Also Works As A Film Producer</span></h2><p>As well as his acting work, Michael Sorvino is also an experienced movie producer. His most recent – and perhaps most successful – project in that regard was the comedy-drama film Almost Paris, which he also featured in.</p><p>Almost Paris was helmed by Martin Scorsese’s daughter Domenica Cameron-Scorsese, in what was her feature film directorial debut.

Their biggest collaboration, however, would be the 2005 miniseries Human Trafficking, which also starred The Hunger Games star, Donald Sutherland.</p><p>Mira portrayed lead character Agent Kate Morozov, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">for which she earned a Golden Globe nomination</a> for Best Actress in a Miniseries or Television Film.

Similarly, she also became a family person in the same way he was. While Paul Sorvino got married thrice, though, Mira has been in the same marriage since June 2004.</p><p>The actress’ husband is Christopher Backus. He is also an actor, with credits in Will & Grace, The O.C. and Redline, among others.
