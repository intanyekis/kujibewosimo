It wasn't until he met Alves that he decided he was going to need a bigger boat. The couple met in a surprisingly interesting way, however. Alves didn't even know who he was.</p><p>Here's a look at how the McConaugheys met.</p><h2 id=he-had-to-win-her-affections-while-speaking-a-different-language>He Had To Win Her Affections While Speaking A Different Language</h2><p>Surprisingly,&nbsp;McConaughey&nbsp;isn't the type of celebrity who dates his co-stars, but that doesn't mean he didn't look around. Like most people, McConaughey was on a constant journey to find "the one," and up until meeting Alves, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he didn't think he'd ever find her.</a></p><p>So he let his guard down for a bit, thinking to himself that he'd been "looking too hard."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Why Matthew McConaughey Loves His Ordinary Life In His Airstream Trailer</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I was like, 'Wait, just wait. Be yourself. She’ll come if she’s supposed to come. And if she doesn’t, that’s okay, you’re still a good man, McConaughey,'" the actor told People.</p><p>"That’s when she showed up, and she moved right to left in front of my eyes across that club. It was as if she was floating. And I did not say, ‘Who is that?’ I said, ‘<i>What</i> is that?’ And then introduced myself."</p><p>The night they met is certainly one McConaghey will never forget. He had no idea he'd meet the love of his life on a night out, back in 2006.&nbsp;He was with his friend Lance Armstrong, making margaritas when he spotted her from across the room. It was pretty much love at first sight.</p><p>"Since that evening I have not wanted to spend time with any other woman, definitely have not wanted to sleep with anyone else. I’ve not wanted to have children with anyone else other than her," he continued. "We have a love that we never question."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew McConaughey Once Convinced Jennifer Garner Not To Quit Acting</a></span></p><p>McConaughey sort of fumbled trying to get her to come over and had to give himself a little pep talk, but eventually, he made his way over to her and invited her and her friend over to his table.</p><p>Thankfully, McConaughey knew enough Portuguese, or else he wouldn't have been able to speak to her. He's still proud of his skills in the language to this day.</p><p>"We had a great connection. I spoke better Spanish and Portuguese that night than I have since, you know what I mean?" McConaughey told Oprah.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After all the stress that McConaughey had to go through just to get her to talk to him, he had to also deal with the fact that Alves had no idea who she was talking to. She didn't have a clue that she was talking to a famous celebrity at all. To be fair, McConaughey's appearance, at the time, was a bit misleading.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Is Matthew McConaughey's Brother Rooster?</a></span></p><p>"The first interaction, I did not know who he was," Alves&nbsp;told Access Hollywood. "At the time, he had a really long beard and he had this Rasta hat. He was all covered up, and I didn’t really realize who he was."</p><p>Despite McConaughey's weird appearance, Alves seemed to like him enough to go on a date with him.</p><p>"It’s gotta be the right person but it has to be the right time," McConaughey&nbsp;told People in 2017. "We went out on our first date three nights later and I knew then that the next night I wanted to go on another date … And I've been wanting to go on a date with her for the last nine years. And not with anybody else."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=marriage-wasn-t-the-first-thing-on-their-minds>Marriage Wasn't The First Thing On Their Minds</h2><p>After dating for two years, Alves gave birth to their first child, Levi, in 2008, and two years later, their daughter Vida came. It was only after the births of their first two children that they thought maybe they should get married.</p><p>"Well, we had children first. Two of our children before we got married before she handed me the invitation to our wedding," McConaughey joked to People.</p><p>McConaughey actually proposed to Alves on Christmas Eve in 2011. The next year they finally tied the knot after being together for six years. Levi was the ring bearer and Vida was the flower girl. Shortly after, their family was complete when their third child, Livingston, was born.</p><p>Parenting these three little humans is the best thing that's ever happened to the couple, who have the same "moral bottom line." They are letting their kids form their own personalities but "shepherd them" as much as possible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They've come a long way from thinking they'd never find their soulmates. Alves never even thought she'd get married. Now they have this incredible marriage and family, traveling the world with each other, appearing on red carpets and awards shows. We're so jealous. McConaughey is L-I-V-I-N man.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Most Amazing Revelations From Matthew McConaughey's Memoir 'Greenlights'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbalecyaq62glax6rq%2FCqKWarZedsrp5zJ6crWWYnsBuw8ifnGabkaK2ra2MmqOvnaNk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-did-matthew-mcconaughey-meet-his-wife-camila-alves.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-did-matthew-mcconaughey-meet-his-wife-camila-alves.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-did-matthew-mcconaughey-meet-his-wife-camila-alves.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-did-matthew-mcconaughey-meet-his-wife-camila-alves.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-did-matthew-mcconaughey-meet-his-wife-camila-alves.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-did-matthew-mcconaughey-meet-his-wife-camila-alves.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-to-unlock-an-iphone-a-step-by-step-guide.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-to-unlock-an-iphone-a-step-by-step-guide.html>How to Unlock an iPhone: A Step-by-Step Guide</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./greg-plitt-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>Greg Plitt Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./greg-plitt-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
