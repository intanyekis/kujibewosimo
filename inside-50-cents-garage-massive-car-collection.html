Like many other rappers who identify with the street life, 50 Cent's life had been plagued by the harshness of poverty, violence, and drug infestation of the inner city. His story is clearly outlined in his movie Get Rich or Die Tryin' starring <a href=#>acclaimed actor Terrence Howard</a>, Leon Robinson, and Marc John Jefferies. Together with a vibrant music and acting career as well as multiple entrepreneurial ventures, he has amassed a net worth of over $40 million. With that amount of coin, here are some of the most expensive cars in 50 Cent's garage.</p><h2 id=bugatti-chiron---3-2-million>Bugatti Chiron - $3.2 Million</h2><p>Besides a thriving rap music career, 50 Cent is one of the few rappers in the music industry who has found massive success through other business ventures which have been very lucrative. For example, his G-Unit Clothing company has sold over $100 million in retail sales since being founded in 2003, and even outsold top brands from other major artists like<a href=#> Jay-Z's Roca Wear clothing </a>in its prime. With millions coming in from different income streams, 50 Cent could afford to purchase a $3.2 million Bugatti Chiron. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Car and Driver</a>, this hyper car carries a 1500-hp engine that accelerates from zero to 60 mph in just 2.3 seconds, with a top speed of 261 mph. He can proudly join the list of other<a href=#> celebrities who own Bugatti's like Floyd Mayweather</a>, Tom Cruise, and Jay Leno.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=maserati-mc12---2-4-million>Maserati MC12 - $2.4 Million</h2><p>It would appear that 50 Cent has an unquenchable need for speed, as one can assume from the caliber of vehicles he owns in his garage. The type of speed produced by the Maserati MC12 is actually meant for a race track, and 50 was fortunate enough to secure one of the rarest units of the FIA GT Championship car worth $2.4 million. This speed demon keeps a 6.0 V12 engine under its hood and boasts a maximum top speed of 205 mph. As rare as the Italian machine is, Jackson is accompanied by celebrities such as actress Cameron Diaz, <a href=#>Fast and Furious actor Tyrese Gibson</a>, Vanessa Williams, and Lindsay Lohan who also own the fine car specimen.</p><h2 id=enzo-ferrari---1-million>Enzo Ferrari - $1 Million</h2><p>50 Cent's style is definitely one of exclusivity, and this next sportscar will prove why. Taking the place of the third most expensive car on this list, the Enzo Ferrari is worth $1 million and there are only 375 units that have been manufactured in the world, according to Auto Bizz. The vehicle is named after Enzo Ferrari, the founder of the Ferrari automobile, and is equipped with an F140 V12 engine that has a maximum speed of 218 mph and touches 60 mph in just 3.3 seconds. For someone who isn't a <a href=#>professional race car driver</a>, he owns cars that are terrifyingly fast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lamborghini-aventador-roadster---460-000>Lamborghini Aventador Roadster - $460,000</h2><p>In celebrity circles, the Lamborghini Aventador is like the "affordable" luxury sports car that is almost a right of passage into the lives of the rich and famous. However, affordable for the rich and famous is $460,000, which is roughly the price of the vehicle. According to the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Lamborghini website,</a> under the hood of the Aventador is a 740 hp V12 engine that provides a powerful yet smooth ride. The Roadster's exterior is defined by a blend of refinement and aggressiveness, qualities that allow it to dominate the road with ease. It's for this reason that other<a href=#> top celebrities such as rapper Nikki Minaj</a>, Kanye West, Chris Brown, and Sean "P.Diddy" Combs all subscribe to the powers of the Lambo.</p><h2 id=rolls-royce-phantom-coupe---450-000>Rolls Royce Phantom Coupe - $450,000</h2><p>As one of the kings of hip-hop, it's only right that he rides around in the king of luxury vehicles - The Rolls Royce Phantom Coupe. The Rolls Royce vehicle already screams opulence and class just from its massively built exterior. Add to that the attractive paint job and shiny chrome rims that he has glamorized it with and you have a finished product that is the envy of other celebs. The massively-built luxury vehicle weighs around 2,600 kg (5732 lbs), making it spacious enough to accommodate all the luxury it provides. It also sports a huge twin-turbo V12 engine along with an eight-speed automatic and rear-wheel drive. It's no wonder why some of <a href=#>Hollywood's favorite elites such as Jay-Z and Beyonce,</a> Shaquille O'Neal, Jennifer Lopez, and TMT founder Floyd Mayweather all own one!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lamborghini-aventador-superveloce---420-000>Lamborghini Aventador Superveloce - $420,000</h2><p>As if one Lamborghini wasn't enough for the Vitamin Water minority stake holder, Curtis Jackson just couldn't resist the urge to lay his wealthy hands on another enhanced version, this time a Lamborghini Aventador SV worth between $420,000 to $500,000. There isn't much difference between the two Lambos as they both clock a top speed of 217-218 mph and both carry at 6.2-liter V-12 engine, according to Car and Driver and<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> The Car Guide.</a> The only difference is that the Aventador's engine generates 769-hp while the Aventador SV generates 750-hp. <a href=#>A few other big name celebrities who own Lamborghinis</a> include music artist Justin Bieber, Nicki Minaj, and Kylie Jenner.</p><h2 id=rolls-royce-wraith---330-000>Rolls Royce Wraith - $330,000</h2><p>They say if it's nice then do it twice. This must be 50 Cent's mantra as he has done that with not only his Lamborghinis, but also his Rolls Royce luxury vehicles, this time a powerful Rolls Royce Wraith, regarded as one of the most powerful and dynamic Rolls Royce vehicles in history. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Top Gear, </a>it possesses ten per cent more power than is available in the Phantom and Cullinan and is backed by a turbocharged 6.6-liter V-12 engine. Weighing 2.4 tonnes, it accelerates from zero to 60 mph in under 4.4 seconds and carries a price tag of $330,000. Among the other celebs who own a Rolls Royce Wraith includes <a href=#>pop artist Gwen Stefani.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lamborghini-urus---200-000>Lamborghini Urus - $200,000</h2><p>50 Cent's fetish for driving the fanciest and fastest cars knows no limits, since this next vehicle is simply the best in its class. Adding to his two Lamborghini Aventador sportscars is the Lamborghini Urus. The Urus is the only high performance SUV manufactured by the Lamborghini dealership and, as expected, it's the fastest SUV in the world. With an engine that generates 657hp, can max out at a top speed of 190 mph, and jets from zero to 60 mph in 3.1 seconds, it's no wonder it broke the Pikes Peak SUV performance record in July 2022, beating the Bentley Bentayga by 18 seconds! <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Mensxp</a>, their performance is probably the reason the Urus is so beloved by <a href=#>many famous Bollywood actors.</a></p><h2 id=mercedes-amg-g63---150-000>Mercedes AMG G63 - $150,000</h2><p>Besides the Land Rover Range Rover Sport and the Cadillac Escalade, the Mercedes AMG G63 is among the most popular luxury off-road sports vehicles in the rap and hip-hop culture. The robust exterior of this high-powered machine exudes power and class at first glance, but is also powered by a V8 twin turbo engine that generates 577 hp and can reach a top speed of 149 mph. A few<a href=#> celebrities who have also been drawn to the Mercedes AMG G-Class include rappers T.I.</a> and Travis Scott, NBA player Steph Curry's wife Ayesha Curry, and professional baseball player Matt Kemp. One of these beautiful beasts cost about $150,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:<a href=#> The 8 Most Expensive Watches And Jewelry In 50 Cent's Collection</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mensxp</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Top Gear</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Car Guide</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lamborghini</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Car and Driver</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Complex</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8inqqKclWKCcXnCnqWtq12crrOtxp5kppmjqLa3sYycmKtlk6S5rbHCraCopl8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finside-50-cents-garage-massive-car-collection.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2finside-50-cents-garage-massive-car-collection.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2finside-50-cents-garage-massive-car-collection.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2finside-50-cents-garage-massive-car-collection.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finside-50-cents-garage-massive-car-collection.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2finside-50-cents-garage-massive-car-collection.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kanye-west-hosts-yeezus-album-listening-nyc-161212.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kanye-west-hosts-yeezus-album-listening-nyc-161212.html>Kanye West Hosts #Yeezus Album Listening In NYC</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./emiliano-gonz-lez.html>Emiliano Gonzlez</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./emiliano-gonz-lez.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
