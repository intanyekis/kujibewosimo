The lyrics express the desire for a partner who is real, worth the time and effort, and accepts the flaws of the singer instead of trying to change or control them. The singer has been trying to find love in a world that can be cold and unfeeling. The singer does not ask for perfection but someone who can love and treat them with respect and honesty. The chorus emphasizes this desire for a relationship that is loving, accepting, and different from the superficial and unfulfilling relationships she has had in the past.</p><br><p>The singer recognizes that in the past, she was searching for something that did not last, and she was with the wrong people for the wrong reasons. The singer acknowledges that she was looking for a thrill rather than a genuine connection. The song reflects the singer's desire for someone who will keep it real with her and not just be with her for their own selfish reasons. The song offers a message of hope that there is someone out there who will treat her like somebody and not just like anybody.</p><br><p>Overall, the song is a powerful message about finding love and acceptance. It is a reminder that everyone deserves to be treated with respect and love, and it encourages listeners to hold out for the love and partnership that they deserve.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline
