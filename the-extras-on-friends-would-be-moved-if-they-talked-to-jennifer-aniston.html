Coolidge called the experience a serious one, and we'll reveal why.</p><p>In addition, we'll take a closer look on what it was like to be an extra on the show. Comedian Anjelah Johnson opened up about her experience and surprisingly, there were a lot more protocols to it than most fans expected, like what would happen if extras tried speaking to <strong><a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a></strong>. We'll reveal what that was like, and how shooting an episode of Friends differentiated from other sitcoms.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Appearing On Friends Turned Into A Nightmare For Debra Jo Rupp</a></span></p><h2 id=working-on-friends-was-an-intimidating-process-even-for-the-most-experienced-actors-like-jennifer-coolidge>Working On Friends Was An Intimidating Process, Even For The Most Experienced Actors Like Jennifer Coolidge</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/friends.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout its 10 season run, Friends had so many memorable guest stars, however, the experience was a nervous one a lot of the time for celebs going on the series. Not only was the show a major hit, but the main cast also had a close connection.</p><p>Jennifer Coolidge had lots of experience but despite that, <a href=#>she still felt intimidated heading in.</a></p><p>"I have to say, I was kind of intimidated, even though I knew Lisa because she was in a comedy group. But I didn't know the rest of them, and I was very intimidated because they were all so attractive and had it going on.

Sometimes I come in and throw some lines, and they come up and say, 'You know, Jennifer, we're just going to stick to the script.' That was a serious show."</p><p>As it turns out, the vibe was also a serious one for those working as extras.</p><h2 id=comedian-anjelah-johnson-revealed-extras-on-friends-were-given-strict-directions-which-included-not-talking-to-the-main-cast>Comedian Anjelah Johnson Revealed Extras On Friends Were Given Strict Directions, Which Included Not Talking To The Main Cast</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/friends-rachel.png><p>Fans of Friends don't miss much, and that includes the extras on the show.

They couldn't talk given that it would've been picked up by the cameras and in addition, they needed to make sure they were talking one at a time during their convos at the coffee house.</p><p>Johnson would also make another major reveal, stating that the extras were discouraged from talking to the main cast during shoots.</p><p>"There was protocol being an extra. If someone tried talking to the stars, that's a big no no, you're out. There would be a girl trying to talk to Jennifer Aniston, while Aniston was waiting for her cue. They would be like, get her, move her out of the way."</p><p>The reveal can be seen in the video below around the 3:00 minute mark.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston Stunned Kelly Ripa And Ryan Seacrest About The Details Of Kissing David Schwimmer For The First Time On Friends</a></span></p><p>Being an extra clearly came with some extra set of rules. However, when it came to the actual shoot of Friends, things were a lot more easygoing compared to some of the sitcoms of today.</p><h2 id=the-shooting-process-of-friends-was-much-more-relaxed-compared-to-other-sitcoms>The Shooting Process Of Friends Was Much More Relaxed Compared To Other Sitcoms</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/laughbefore-2-1024x683.jpeg><p><a href=#>Friends had a different approach when it came to shooting episodes</a>. As revealed by late cast member James Michael Tyler, if a joke didn't land, the stars of the show would give their own input, while writers would also think of a different line on the spot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Everyone would huddle around a table and youâ€™d have members of the cast, Matthew Perry, who would jump in and join the writers so you could get a better laugh."</p><p>"And yes if you didnâ€™t get the right response, because writers laugh at their own jokes, but if it didnâ€™t land theyâ€™d huddle and five minutes later have an entirely different joke that landed."</p><p>Even actress Lisa Kudrow would take it upon herself to ask the audience if they understood a joke in the case that it didn't land how they wanted to.</p><p>This is a very different structure compared to sitcoms like The Big Bang Theory. According to the stars of TBBT, shooting the series was often on a tight schedule, which meant changing lines that were written rarely took place by the cast. This held true for lots of other sitcoms, that didn't dare to touch what was written on the page by the writers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dmsW1vsCsZKimXZu%2FqrHNnapmr5%2BquaV5wZ5kpqemmrFutcVmq6GdqWLBorjKnptmrJ9it6a6zaKdnqpdlruqv9OopWg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-extras-on-friends-would-be-moved-if-they-talked-to-jennifer-aniston.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-extras-on-friends-would-be-moved-if-they-talked-to-jennifer-aniston.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-extras-on-friends-would-be-moved-if-they-talked-to-jennifer-aniston.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-extras-on-friends-would-be-moved-if-they-talked-to-jennifer-aniston.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-extras-on-friends-would-be-moved-if-they-talked-to-jennifer-aniston.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-extras-on-friends-would-be-moved-if-they-talked-to-jennifer-aniston.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./turkish-chef-who-is-salt-bae-wife-everything-on-his-net-worth-2021.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./turkish-chef-who-is-salt-bae-wife-everything-on-his-net-worth-2021.html>Turkish Chef: Who Is Salt Bae Wife?
