The two famously reunited to bring to life a show <a href=#>Eugene created with his son Daniel</a>, the show we all know today as Schitt’s Creek.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything Dan Levy Has Been Up To Since 'Schitt's Creek' Ended</a></span></p><p>Schitt’s Creek and the redemption saga of the Rose family ran for 6 seasons from 2015 - 2020. The show’s appeal depended not only on the father-son dynamic between Eugene Levy’s character, Johnny Rose, and his son David (Daniel Levy), but also the realism that was brought to life by both the stars and the show’s supporting cast of characters, some of whom were also played by members of the Levy family. Along with the Levys and Catherine O'Hara as the Rose family matriarch Moira, the show depended on the comedic timing of <a href=#>Annie Murphy</a> as the ditzy trust fund girl turned brainy PR mastermind, Alexis Rose.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since the show’s conclusion in 2020, it has broken Hollywood records by sweeping both the Emmys and the Golden Globes with each main character winning an award for their performance. Every actor from the show has gone on to their own new projects. Daniel is now a spokesperson for several products, Murphy has a new show called Kevin Can F**ck Himself on AMC, and both O’Hara and Levy can add this show to their already staggering and iconic film and television resumes. But what about the rest of Schitt’s Creek's citizens? What have the rest of the townspeople been up to in 2021?</p><h2 id=bob---john-hemphill><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Bob - John Hemphill</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>John Hemphill is an alumnus of the Second City comedy troupe, the place where Eugene Levy and Katherine O'Hara met and worked alongside other comedy legends, like Rick Moranis, John Candy, and Martin Short. But unlike most of the cast of Schitt’s Creek, Hemphill works more behind the scenes than as an actor. According to IMDb, Schitt’s Creek’s simple-minded mechanic has been the director of the wildly successful comedy troupe Women Fully Clothed since 2003. The troupe is made up of Second City alums like Debra McGrath, Robin Duke, Jayne Eastwood, Teresa Pavlinek, and Kathy Greenwood.</p><h2 id=ronnie---karen-robinson><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Ronnie - Karen Robinson</span></h2><p>Robinson played Veronica, better known as Ronnie, and was Schitt’s Creek’s quick-witted contractor and city councilor. She has continued to act in both Canadian and American television. Since the last episode of Schitt’s Creek, Robinson has acted in shows like Star Trek: Discovery, A Million Little Things, and DC’s Titans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jocelyn---jennifer-robertson><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jocelyn - Jennifer Robertson</span></h2><p>Jocelyn, the town’s teacher and wife of the mayor Roland Schitt (Chris Elliott), was played by Jennifer Robertson. Robertson has since landed a recurring role as Ellen Baker on the Netflix series Ginny and Georgia and roles in the films Crawlspace and Single All The Way, the latter starring Michael Urie, Barry Bostwick, and Jennifer Coolidge.</p><h2 id=stevie---emily-hampshire><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Stevie - Emily Hampshire</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hampshire, a.k.a. Stevie Budd, the smart-ass motel clerk turned sensible businesswoman, has continued to work both on and off-screen. She loaned her voice to an episode of Robot Chicken and a narrative podcast series called The Beautiful Liar. She plays Rebecca Morgan in Adrian Brody’s new show Chapelwaite and is slated to play Mary Hartman in the remake of Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman. Fun fact, prior to working with the Levys on Schitt’s Creek. Hampshire worked regularly with another Canadian comedian, <a href=#>Jay Baruchel.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Catherine O'Hara's Wigs On 'Schitt's Creek'</a></span></p><h2 id=twyla---sarah-levy><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Twyla - Sarah Levy</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sarah Levy played the town's waitress who was oddly upbeat about her dark and depressing past. Daniel Levy’s sibling has continued working in film and television, although at a much more low-key pace than her father and brother. She played Chloe in the 2021 film Distancing Socially, she appeared in 10 episodes of SurrealEstate, and she was in a TV mini-series called Stories of Kindness.</p><h2 id=patrick---noah-reid><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Patrick - Noah Reid</span></h2><p>Reid won the hearts of the audience as the love interest of David Rose, and the couple brought a new type of gay relationship to TV, a topic that is often inappropriately or degradingly handled in Hollywood. Since the end of the show, Reid has appeared in a short film titled The Archivists. Prior to Schitt’s Creek, Reid already had a respectable television resume, with credits on House of Lies and Degrassi. Reid is also a musician and in 2020 wrote and performed a song for an episode of The Morning Show, which stars Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Did Noah Reid Feel About Playing Daniel Levy's Boyfriend On 'Schitt's Creek'</a></span></p><h2 id=roland---chris-elliott><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Roland - Chris Elliott</span></h2><p>Roland Schitt, the infuriatingly piggish mayor and family namesake of Schitt’sCreek was easily the biggest piece of comic relief on the show. Chris Elliott has always worked steadily as a comedy character actor ever since leaving SNL in the 90s, often playing people as unappealing or simple-minded as Roland Schitt. Chris Elliott has a few new roles lined up for the future, including an appearance in a film titled Christmas vs the Walters and an episode of a TV series titled Maggie. He is also a writer with four books to his name, and he has recently re-released audio recordings of his books narrated by himself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Everything Daniel Levy Has Said About His Dating Life</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsC2vM%2Boqa2hnpx6sbjAspyrq12osKm1062qZpuimrKsedSpZK2nXWd9c32O</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-supporting-players-schitts-creek-up-to-2021.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-supporting-players-schitts-creek-up-to-2021.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-supporting-players-schitts-creek-up-to-2021.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-supporting-players-schitts-creek-up-to-2021.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-supporting-players-schitts-creek-up-to-2021.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-supporting-players-schitts-creek-up-to-2021.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-rakesh-madhava-from-theranos-the-dropout-hulu-complete-star-cast-real-name-story-more.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-rakesh-madhava-from-theranos-the-dropout-hulu-complete-star-cast-real-name-story-more.html>Who Is Rakesh Madhava From Theranos?
