The song depicts an individual who has changed, not only in their physical appearance but also in their attitude. Post Malone describes this change through the lines “You seem a little different, from the last time I saw you,” and questions their need to be someone new.</p><p>Post Malone then shifts to discussing his own journey and the challenges he faced in making it in the music industry. He showcases his confidence and determination, asserting that he is the shit, and despite the doubts of others, he has proved them wrong. This is evident in the lines “I said what part of ‘I am the shit’ do you not understand” and “For the muhfuckers that said I wasn’t going to be shit, man I got to show that they’re wrong.”</p><p>The chorus of the song, with lines like “I’m faded off a whole pill” and “Ain’t got no fucks to give that’s on moms for real,” can be interpreted as a representation of the hedonistic behavior often associated with the music industry. Post Malone appears to be unapologetic about his choices and indifferent to the opinions of others.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=My_Personal_Experience_with_%E2%80%9CHolyfield%E2%80%9D></span>My Personal Experience with “Holyfield”:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>“Holyfield” holds a special place in my heart as it was one of the songs that accompanied me during a period of personal growth and self-discovery. The lyrics resonated with me on a deep level, reminding me that change is inevitable and that sometimes it’s necessary to distance myself from people who no longer align with my values and goals.</p><p>Post Malone’s raw and unapologetic approach in this song inspired me to stay true to myself and not let the opinions of others define my worth. It served as a reminder that success is often born out of persistence and proving others wrong, just like Post Malone did.</p><p>Overall, “Holyfield” by Post Malone captures the essence of personal transformation, overcoming obstacles, and staying true to oneself. The song’s catchy chorus, combined with its introspective lyrics, makes it a powerful anthem that resonates with listeners on a visceral level. So next time you find yourself listening to “Holyfield,” take a moment to dive into its meaning and connect with the artist behind the music.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminnJnBqrnEpqysoZNjsLC5jrBpaKyYmnquscCnoKefXZeyqbXNnWStoJViwLC6xmafqKSpm7amuMNmmbJloKTAtXnMmqOoppVk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-meaning-behind-the-song-holyfield-by-post-malone.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-meaning-behind-the-song-holyfield-by-post-malone.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-meaning-behind-the-song-holyfield-by-post-malone.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-meaning-behind-the-song-holyfield-by-post-malone.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-meaning-behind-the-song-holyfield-by-post-malone.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-meaning-behind-the-song-holyfield-by-post-malone.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./wiki-net-worth-height-wife-and-career-of-ronnie-coleman.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./wiki-net-worth-height-wife-and-career-of-ronnie-coleman.html>Wiki, Net Worth, Height, Wife And Career Of Ronnie Coleman</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-10-coolest-suvs-for-wealthy-dads.html>The 10 Coolest SUVs for Wealthy Dads</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-10-coolest-suvs-for-wealthy-dads.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
