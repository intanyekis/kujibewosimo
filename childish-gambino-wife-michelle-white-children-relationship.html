It was such a weird moment."</p><p>"It was such an intense, weird moment, because I’m watching that video and it’s like eight minutes long, so you’re sitting there and I had just had this amazing, joyful, expanding moment, plus my dad had passed away recently, so [my son] was named after my father.</p><p>"I don’t even know what, really, the word is to describe it.

I mean I don’t dream as much, I just miss dreaming! I think my partner, she does all the hard stuff, to be honest. She’s just very supportive. I haven’t really had to change anything.
