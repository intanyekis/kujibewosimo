We'll take a look at one of the most memorable, and the strong reaction he received.The truth is, despite the reaction, the veteran actor was very nervous to appear on the sitcom. Following such an ovation, we assume those nerves subsided at least a little.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=friends-had-to-make-a-few-edits-due-to-crowd-noise-over-its-10-seasons>Friends Had To Make A Few Edits Due To Crowd Noise Over Its 10 Seasons</h2><p>Like other sitcoms, Friends went through quite the editing process following the filming of an episode. Everything needed to be on point and that included the crowd noise. During certain scenes, if the crowd got too loud, it would take away from what the character had to say. In some instances the noise was lowered, while in other cases, the scene needed to be re-shot entirely.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>This Friends Guest-Star Said She Was Shocked By Her Emmy Award For Appearing On The Show</a></span></p><p>An average episode of Friends usually took five-hours to shoot. In addition, lines were at time changed on the spot during the shoot. Heck in some instances, the cast was told to make up a better line - Matthew Perry was known for his incredible wit on the show under these circumstances.</p><p>Jennifer Aniston also received quite the reaction to her "world's worst hangover" line alongside Ross. The moment got such a reaction that <a href=#>the crowd noise needed to be edited</a> due to how long the laughter lasted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was a similar situation for a certain iconic Friends guest-star, who fans could not get enough of.</p><h2 id=tom-selleck-had-to-re-shoot-all-of-his-scenes-with-the-friends-audience>Tom Selleck Had To Re-Shoot All Of His Scenes With The Friends Audience</h2><p>The ovations likely made Tom Selleck feel a heck of a lot better, as the actor revealed <a href=#>he was incredibly nervous appearing on the show.</a></p><p>"I was scared to death," he said. "I had done Taxi a long time before, but I hadn't done a sitcom. And so, I was really nervous. Courteney helped a lot. Courteney's a big help. But that group's an incredible group of friends. They obviously became friends in life as well as on the show. And it shows.

It's like when I did Friends," he said. "They were up to speed."</p><p>In truth, Tom really had nothing to worry about. His cameos on the show were very memorable, and he was among the best guest-stars.

And I remember when we were doing a network run-through, the network and the producers would just laugh."</p><p>That person was none other than Fisher Stevens, who played Phoebe's critical boyfriend on the show. Stevens admitted himself to being harsh towards the cast and even apologizing for his behavior. "At that moment in my career, I had never done a sitcom before. I had never heard of Friends because it was just the beginning of the show and I didn't watch TV at the time much."</p><p>A shock to nobody, the actor was never invited back, unlike Tom Selleck's Richard character.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>The Cast Of Friends Blindsided Jennifer Aniston With An Intervention During The Show</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirqKVdqLmtscKkZKedlZmypXnTqGSrnV2otbC702aYpaRdnba0edKcnKedo2Kzs7XEp5usZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftom-slleck-needed-to-re-shoot-all-his-scenes-friends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftom-slleck-needed-to-re-shoot-all-his-scenes-friends.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftom-slleck-needed-to-re-shoot-all-his-scenes-friends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftom-slleck-needed-to-re-shoot-all-his-scenes-friends.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftom-slleck-needed-to-re-shoot-all-his-scenes-friends.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftom-slleck-needed-to-re-shoot-all-his-scenes-friends.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./1256651-top-smackdown-moments-relive-undertaker-vs-jeff-hardy.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./1256651-top-smackdown-moments-relive-undertaker-vs-jeff-hardy.html>Top SmackDown Moments, Relive Undertaker vs. Jeff Hardy</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./robert-plants-staggering-net-worth.html>Robert Plant's Staggering Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./robert-plants-staggering-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
