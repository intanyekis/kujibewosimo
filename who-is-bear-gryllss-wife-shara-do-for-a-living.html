Even though Bear is known by his viewers to be pretty tough and macho, falling in love with his wife Shara turned him somewhat mushy on the first day they met. You would be surprised about <a href=#>things most people don't know about him</a>.</p><p>In 1998 at 23 years old, Bear Grylls first bumped into his wife while he was skinny-dipping. When Bear, real name, Edward Michael Grylls was months onto the preparations of climbing Mount Everest, he was getting into the water after his morning jog on New Year’s Eve at a beach in Scotland. Soon after, Bear saw a very beautiful woman in his eyes walking on the shores. Next, Bear had clothes sitting on the sand when a wave took them away. While he was running around to try and find his trouser, Shara came over and helped him. During an interview with Piers Morgan’s Life Stories, Bear confessed, “It was the worst time in the world to fall in love. She probably felt sorry for me. This weird man running around.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fast-forward to Bear’s proposal to Shara, he decided to propose to Shara the same way he met her by going skinny-dipping together. So before Bear and Shara’s love story cultivated into something unshakable, what was Shara Grylls doing before she met the love of her life?</p><h2 id=who-is-shara-grylls>Who Is Shara Grylls?</h2><p>Shara Grylls was born in England, UK as Shara Cannings Knight in 1974. She loved writing as a child but it was when she met and married Bear that she became a writer by profession. Not much is known about Shara’s childhood that's because Shara is not as much in the public eye as her husband is.</p><p>According to information Cradle, Shara was a former survival instructor, former SAS serviceman, and coronary lieutenant colonel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bear-grylls-and-wife1-png3.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Additionally, nobody is aware of Shara’s education because she has never shared such information with the public. What is assumed though is that she is very learned having bore great titles under her status. Furthermore, it’s unclear if Shara has any siblings. As of 2023, Shara Grylls is 49 years old.</p><p>Bear Grylls and Shara married in 2000, and so far they have been together for 23 years. Bear couldn’t help but celebrate his wife on his Instagram post recently marking their 23rd anniversary with a caption saying, “23 years strong, I love you Shara x.” In the caption Bear also squeezed a happy birthday message to his son Huckles who had just turned 14 years old.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Here’s How Much Bear Grylls Makes Per Season Of ‘Man vs. Wild’">Here’s How Much Bear Grylls Makes Per Season Of ‘Man vs. Wild’</a></span></p><p>Shara and Bear have 3 sons together. Jesse, Marmaduke, and Huckleberry Grylls. They were born in March 2003, April 2006, and January 2009 respectively.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During an interview with The Telegraph, Bear revealed how his wife and children are supportive of what he does and how he always looks forward to returning home safely to a cup of coffee and a bubble bath.</p><p>Bear also said regarding his children's reaction while watching him, “Another time, the kids were watching television and a promo for Born Survivor came on. In it, I was jumping around and stuff and at the end of it my children turned to me and said ‘Papa, what were you thinking?!'”</p><h2 id=this-is-the-tragedy-that-struck-bear-rsquo-s-family-months-after-shara-said-lsquo-i-do-rsquo-to-him>This Is The Tragedy that Struck Bear’s Family Months After Shara Said ‘I Do’ To Him</h2><p>According to The Mirror, just a few months after the lovely couple, Shara and Bear tied the knot, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tragedy hit their family</a>. Sadly, Shara’s father passed away. Just 12 weeks after his death, in February 2001, Bear’s father, a known politician Sir Michael Grylls, also passed away from a heart attack. The Adventurer revealed that this tragedy almost put an end to their marriage. Bear went on to say that he saw a therapist to try and help ease his emotional pain.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bear-grylls-and-wife1-png2.png><p>During an interview with The Times, Bear said, “I didn’t really have a job - and that was a worry - and then her father died. Twelve weeks later my father died. We were living on this rusty barge on the Thames and the boiler was broken. I felt overwhelmed. I couldn’t talk to Shara because I felt I had to be strong for her.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="15 Surprising Facts About Bear Grylls' Time On Discovery's Man Vs.

You’ve got no job, your wife is in a bad way, you’re in a bad way, what are you going to do?’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/bear-grylls-and-wife1-png4.png><p>Depressing thoughts were running through Bear’s mind and all the while, both Bear and his wife, Shara thought they couldn’t make it another day together because of the pain they were experiencing. It’s safe to say now that the beauty of time is that it heals all wounds including theirs.</p><h2 id=what-is-shara-grylls-doing-now>What Is Shara Grylls Doing Now?</h2><p>As we mentioned earlier, Shara is a successful writer by profession.
