In this eBay Partner Network (EPN) review, we are going to take a look at everything eBay currently has to offer, while also covering how site partners can make the most money by promoting eBay to their audiences and also what’s currently working best for site partners today.</p><h2>eBay Partner Network at a Glance</h2><p>We are all familiar with the concept of eBay and how users bid on items and purchase products through their site. The majority of people reading this blog are also familiar with the concept of affiliate marketing, where you earn a commission for sending a lead or new customer to a website. When you combine them both together, you get&nbsp;eBay Partner Network.</p><p style=text-align:center><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Share_your_passion___eBay_Partner_Network.png alt=Share_your_passion___eBay_Partner_Network width=701 height=287 sizes="(max-width: 701px) 100vw, 701px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Before joining any affiliate or partner network, the most common questions are how to make money with the program, what the payout commissions are and when payments will be sent out. We’ve answered each of these questions for you below.</p><p><strong>What do I get paid?</strong></p><p>EPN partners are paid out a commission based on the revenue that eBay earns from each transaction. This commission amount is between 40% and 80% depending on the product type. The important thing to note here is that you a paid a commission on “eBay’s revenue” and not the final sale price of items on eBay.</p><p>A commission is earned when a site partner sends someone to eBay and they make a purchase within 24-hours, even if the auction may take up to 10 days to end. You can see an example of three of the most popular commission payouts based on Toys, Electronics and Fashion below. For a full breakdown on all commission payouts, refer to eBay’s rate card.</p><p style=text-align:center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/eBay_Partner_Network_Commission_Payouts.png alt=eBay_Partner_Network_Commission_Payouts width=447 height=253 sizes="(max-width: 447px) 100vw, 447px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>When do I get paid?</strong></p><p>Commissions are paid out to eBay Partner Network members on a monthly basis when the minimum threshold of $25 is met.
