Years before that, Wahlberg also publicly revealed how annoyed he was with Beckham when he complained about the athlete and his Spice Girls wife Victoria Beckham.</p><p>This article will reveal why <strong>Mark Wahlberg once complained about David and Victoria Beckham</strong>.

After all, as fans of Entourage will already know, the show which included a lot of partying was partly based on Wahlberg's real life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, after becoming a husband and father, Wahlberg seems to like a quieter lifestyle. As a result, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">when David and Victoria Beckham began living near him</a>, <strong>Wahlberg complained about how they ruined the neighborhood</strong> during a 2009 Daily Mail interview.</p><p>"Man, the Beckhams. It used to be so quiet on my road. Then David moves in with his family. Suddenly we’ve got paparazzi hanging out day and night. Now they’ll follow any car that drives down the road. I take strong exception to that kind of thing.

It is important to note that Wahlberg got in a lot of legal trouble when he was young thanks to his involvement in several violent incidents.</p><p>"Where I come from it's not considered wise to follow people around like that unless you're looking for serious trouble.

After all, there is a long history of the paparazzi endangering celebrities and Wahlberg had his kids and wife living there.</p><p><strong>Which celebrities were dangerously chased by the paparazzi, according to Grunge?</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Princess Diana</strong></li><li><strong>Britney Spears</strong></li><li><strong>Lindsay Lohan</strong></li><li><strong>David Beckham</strong></li><li><strong>Scarlett Johansson</strong></li><li><strong>Reese Witherspoon</strong></li><li><strong>Caitlyn Jenner</strong></li><li><strong>Chris Brown</strong></li><li><strong>Sienna Miller</strong></li><li><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></li><li><strong>Tori Spelling</strong></li><li><strong>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle</strong></li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/britney-spears-former-friend-sued-her-after-an-alleged-assault-involving-her-father-jamie-spears-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Britney Spears' Former Friend Sued Her After An Alleged Assault Involving Her Father Jamie Spears">Britney Spears' Former Friend Sued Her After An Alleged Assault Involving Her Father Jamie Spears</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Britney Spears' controversial father allegedly assaulted the pop star's former friend which led to a lawsuit.</p><p>Still, it is surprising to look back at the fact that <strong>Wahlberg talked about his annoyance with Beckham</strong> at such length during his Daily Mail interview. Wahlberg even went on to talk about his belief that Americans wouldn't be interested in Beckham's sport.</p><p>"I'm not telling Beckham to take his family home. I'm just not sure why he came to America in the first place. Man, we don't want your soccer.

However, the quotes don't seem to communicate how angry Wahlberg reportedly was.</p><p>According to Hello Magazine, David and Victoria Beckham sold their Beverly Hills home in 2018. The famous couple reportedly sold the home in an off-market deal for $33 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to the writer of The Daily Mail's article, <strong>Wahlberg was about to "boil over" as he spoke about Beckham</strong>.

As a result, <strong>Beckham sued Wahlberg's company for $10 million</strong> he says he was owed in value. According to Beckham, he was supposed to receive $10 million worth of stock in the company.</p><p>In response to Beckham's lawsuit and claims, a lawyer for Wahlberg's company called his accusations baseless.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqqbYsSitMubnKufXZmut7XDZpmem5udrq55y5qurK2ZqXqzscuaq6Knnqi1qryO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmark-wahlberg-david-beckham-lawsuit-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmark-wahlberg-david-beckham-lawsuit-relationship.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmark-wahlberg-david-beckham-lawsuit-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmark-wahlberg-david-beckham-lawsuit-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmark-wahlberg-david-beckham-lawsuit-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmark-wahlberg-david-beckham-lawsuit-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./nick-cannon-turning-down-a-4-5-million-deal-with-hollywood.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./nick-cannon-turning-down-a-4-5-million-deal-with-hollywood.html>Nick Cannon Turning Down A $4.5 Million Deal With Hollywood</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./299418-good-times-dad-john-amos-turns-83-he-tos-html.html>Good Times Dad John Amos Turned 83 - He Tossed Aside Cane to Dance with Daughter Weeks before</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./299418-good-times-dad-john-amos-turns-83-he-tos-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
