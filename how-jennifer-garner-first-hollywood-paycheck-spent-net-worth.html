Since the state is a no-fault state, courts often enforce a 50-50 split of the fortune the Hollywood couple made during their time together. TMZ reported Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck's divorce was hectic and time-consuming because <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Affleck and Garner did not have a prenup</a>;</strong> all their fortune and property had to be split between them, regardless of who made the most money while they were together.</p><p>The former couple had bought a Los Angeles mansion in 2009 while married for $17.55 million, which they later sold to singer Adam Levine for a whopping $32 million in 2018.

According to several reports, the Batman VS Superman actor told The New York Times that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he started drinking heavily</a> after his marriage with Garner began to deteriorate in 2015. By the time their marriage ended in 2018, Affleck could not even sign the divorce papers as he was facing more sobriety issues and had been checked into rehab by Garner to<a href=#> ease their new relationship as co-parents.</a></p><p><strong>At the time, the former couple had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a combined net worth of $190 million</a>, which they might have split equally.</strong> Garner, who had a net worth of $60 million at the time, added a few million to her bank account after finalizing the divorce from the father of her three children.</p><h2 id=how-jennifer-garner-earns-and-spends-her-80-million-net-worth>How Jennifer Garner Earns And Spends Her $80 Million Net Worth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/jennifer-garner-attending-the-2022-jhpiego-awards-ceremony.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jennifer Garner has been a successful leading lady for decades and has enabled her to amass an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">impressive net worth of $80 million</a>.
